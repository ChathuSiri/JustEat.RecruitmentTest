UI Engineer (Product Research) Tech Test
========================================

Thank you for taking the time to do our technical test. It consists of two parts:

* [A coding test](#coding-test)
* [A few questions](#technical-questions)

In order to avoid bounced emails we would like you to submit your results by uploading the relevant zip file to a shared **Google Drive** folder. In order to obtain the URL for this folder please supply your **Gmail** or **Google-based email address** to either your agent or the Just Eat member of staff who assigned you the test.

Please make this a **single** zip file named `{yourname}-{role-applied-for}.zip` containing:

1. one folder containing the coding test
2. a single markdown file with the answers to the questions

## Coding Test

The test is simple, just:

* Create an HTML file (and any additional CSS/JavaScript files you need) that does something with the JSON in [this sample of restaurant search results](restaurant-search-results.md).

The test is open-ended, but please don't feel you need to spend more than an hour on it. We're looking for code that is readable and that shows off your abilities, but most of all we want to see something interesting.

##  Questions

* What would you add to your test if you had more time?
* What's the best thing added to JavaScript in the last few years?
* What's a feature you wish existed when you're ordering takeaway online?
* What JSON would describe you?

Thanks for your time, we look forward to hearing from you!
