Web UI Tech Test
============

Thank you for taking the time to do our technical test. It consists of two parts:

* [A coding test](#coding-test)
* [A few technical questions](#technical-questions)

In order to avoid bounced emails we would like you to submit your results by uploading the relevant zip file to a shared **Google Drive** folder. In order to obtain the URL for this folder, please supply your **Gmail** or **Google-based email address** to either your agent or the Just Eat member of staff who assigned you the test.

Please make this a **single** zip file named `{yourname}-{role-applied-for}.zip` containing:

1. one folder containing the coding test
2. a single markdown file with the answers to the technical questions

## Coding Test

* Create an HTML file that has a login form with a username and password. Use semantic, accessible and valid mark-up.
* Style the form so that labels are to the left of the fields and inputs are to the right of the fields.
* Write script that defines a `FormValidator` constructor with methods on the prototype to validate and display error messages for invalid username/password. It only has to check whether the fields are blank or not.
* Use external scripts and CSS files.
* Don't pollute the global object (Only one should be required for the namespace you choose)
* Test drive the code via unit tests (Jasmine or an equivalent)
* Should work in IE11+ as well as more modern browsers.

## Technical Questions

* Did you have time to complete the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time?
* What's your favourite programming language? Why?
* List a few of your preferred JavaScript frameworks (also let us know in which situations you would choose to use/not use them)
* Please describe yourself using either XML or JSON.

Thanks for your time, we look forward to hearing from you!
